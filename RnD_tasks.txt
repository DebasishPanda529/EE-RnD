Simulating the SSH model (will be starting with the Kitaev model later) -
 a) Plot energy eigenvalues of the SSH chain against v/w
 b) Plot wavefunctions against position (which is represented by the lattice points)

Chapters 8 & 9 of 'Quantum Transport - Atom to Transistor', along with the corresponding simulations.

For NEGF - Refer to the graphene portion of LNE (somewhere around chap 19-22) and the simulations done for the devices in Fig.9.5.4 of the Quantum Transport book. Expected to cover all this stuff before the semester ends.

Next comes the application of NEGF to superconductors, such as simulating S|N|S (Josephson junction), N|S (Andreev), and N|S|N (Kitaev).
